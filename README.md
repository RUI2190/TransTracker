We proposed a multipartite graph model (with DNA sequences as parts and potential TSDs as nodes) that creatively represents a fungal DNA population. To decipher the historical movement of a transposon in a population, we designed two methods based on DFS and ILP to reconstruct the optimal traversing path in the multipartite graph.
